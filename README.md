<h1 style="margin-top: 40px; border-top: 0.5px gray solid; padding: 20px;"> How to use</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create an account</strong>: When creating your account, you will be asked to create or to join an existing schedule. You will receive an email verification to activate your account.</li>
<li><strong>Admin</strong>: Share your schedule id to your team. You can change shifts name, start time or end time. Once the 2 period week has passed, you can no longer modify this. When changing shifts start or end time, there is validation in place to prevent the following from happening: 
  <ul>
  <li>Shifts cannot be longer than 14 hours.</li> 
  <li>Shift start time cannot start after current shift end time, or before previous shift start time.</li>
  <li>Shift end time cannot end before current shift start time, or after next shift end time.</li>
  </ul>
  The admin can also add or remove 2 weeks at the time. When adding weeks, it will follow the date/time format and rules (some months have 31 days others 30 sometimes 28 in the case of february). Weeks always start on Sunday. The admin can also email everyone the current 2 weeks of schedule and the next 2 if they exist. The admin can also view everyone total hours worked during the current 2 weeks or 4 weeks if they exist, and the past 2 weeks as well as the hours worked at all times.
</li>

<li><strong>Non admin</strong>: When creating your account, use the id of the schedule that you would like to join. The user will have his/her shifts assigned by the admin. Once the shift has been created, the user can choose to mark their shift as available (orange color) to any other user that wants it. The user may cancel this action. The user may also choose to accept someones else shift that is available</li>

<li><strong>All users</strong>: All users can change to dark mode from their profile page. All users may see current, past, and future schedules.</li>
</ul>
